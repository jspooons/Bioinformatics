# Bioinformatics
Small repository for small programs making analyses of gene and protein sequences a lil bit easier :P

My setup is Anaconda environment on Pycharm
I installed pillow via 'pip install pillow' in the pycharm terminal

If you are experiencing OSError from not having arial font installed for example, there are solutions online. One that worked for a friend who just copied and pasted this code into Spyder in Anaconda (Anaconda has pillow automatically downloaded btw), then download arial.ttf from here: https://github.com/JotJunior/PHP-Boleto-ZF2/blob/master/public/assets/fonts/arial.ttf

Put arial.ttf in the location of where your .py file is with your copied and pasted code.

Then on lines 175 and 166, change /Library/Fonts/arial.ttf to arial.ttf

Last thing, the output image is called 'palindromes.png' and is saved to the location of where your .py file is.

Enjoy :)
